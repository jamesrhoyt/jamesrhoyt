👋 Hi, i'm James Hoyt! In 2012, I graduated from Rochester Institute of Technology with a B.S. in Game Design & Development, and a Minor in Japanese Language & Culture.

🕹 From November 2012 to August 2013, I worked at The National Museum of Play at The Strong, as a video capture archivist for old video games. Essentially, I would record 10-20 minute long videos of older (Pre-2005) video games, which were meant to display a "vertical slice" of those games: a summary of their mechanics, features, and unique elements.

👨🏽‍💻 Currently, I'm looking for work in the video game industry, and have been attempting to build a project portfolio to show what I can do and how fast I can pick up new skills. My specialties are C# and C++, and I have experience with JavaScript and Python as well. I also have a lot of experience developing in the Unity Engine.

👀 I'm interested in learning how to develop for the Unreal Engine, and particularly in 3D Animation. On the 2D side of game art, I'm trying to improve as a pixel artist, in order to better emulate the 16-bit style of early-'90s games.

🎥 I'm also attempting to improve my skills in several other hobbies of mine, including 📷 landscape/urban photography, 🎥 film analysis and critique, ✍🏽 video game critique, and 🎵 music curation. 🈸 I'm also still practicing Japanese via DuoLingo, hoping to develop a working proficiency, possibly even fluency.

📫 I have a Twitter (@Shadownails), an Instagram (@VocabularianBob), a LinkedIn, a Spotify, and a Letterboxd account.
